# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is used in response of accessing part of large amounts of data. OOP lets you take small snippets of the code base without affecting the whole entire part. Functional programming is only programming the parts that make it work.

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming, OOP, is a way to create containers of data that can be changed and manipulated without affecting a large program. Functional programming is using functions to create clean and maintainable software.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: An integer is any whole number. A float is a number with a decimal value.
For example, an integer can be the number 2 while a float can be 2.0.

Researched answer: Integers in Ruby are any whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero numbers that do not have a fractional part. Floats are non-whole numbers that contain a fractional part or a decimal.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: An implicit return is the even though there is no return statement, Ruby will return the last line of the code block.
Example: 
```Ruby
def num number
    number
end
```

Researched answer: An implicit return means that if there is no return statement, the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is where you would put the logic of the method and uses the keyword 'end' to define the scope.

Researched answer: A Ruby block is an anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome. They are usually encapsulated using the keywords 'do' and 'end'.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: You can extract a value inside of a Ruby hash by using the .keys method

Researched answer: To extract a value inside of a Ruby hash, you use the .keys method and it will return an array of the values from the hash. If you want to find a specific value, you can call the index since the values are in an array.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is the relationship of passing data between a superclass and a subclass.

2. RSpec: RSpec, request specification, is a domain specific language used for testing the behavior of objects in Ruby.

3. CRUD: CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete. CRUD is a programmer's checklist describing the complete list of data manipulations.

4. Test-driven development: Test-driven development, TDD, is a philosophy of writing tests, seeing them fail, then creating the code that makes the test pass.

5. HTTP: HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. HTTP is the set of rules for transferring files over the web.
